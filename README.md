Diabetes is a chronic health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy.

With diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin or can't use it as well as it should.

Types of Diabetes:
      There are three main types of diabetes: type 1, type 2,      
      and gestational diabetes.

There isnâ€™t a cure yet for diabetes!

The World Health Organization aims to stimulate and support the adoption of effective measures for the surveillance, 
prevention, and control of diabetes and its complications.

We see a lot of efforts in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to raise awareness and increase health culture in many contributions.

Those contributions fall in one way or another to Achieving one of the goals of the Kingdom's Vision 2030 by increasing 
the average age of citizens from 74 to 80 years.
